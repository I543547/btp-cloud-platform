# Creating an ABAP System

Create a service instance for the ABAP environment from the Service Marketplace.



<a name="loio50b32f144e184154987a06e4b55ce447__prereq_cbh_1ft_r4b"/>

## Prerequisites

You have increased the quota for the ABAP environment. See [Increasing the Quota for the ABAP Environment](increasing-the-quota-for-the-abap-environment-c40cb18.md).

## Context

> ### Note:  
> If you have run the booster *Prepare an Account for ABAP Development*, you can also skip this step.

For more information about creating service instances, see [Create Service Instances Using the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/8221b7434d8e484fab5ec5d219b7bf64.html).



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the SAP BTP cockpit and navigate to the Cloud Foundry subaccount. See [Navigate in the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/0874895f1f78459f9517da55a11ffebd.html).

2.  From the navigation area, choose *Services* \> *Service Marketplace.* 

    You see a list of all services that are available to you.

3.  Choose *ABAP environment*.

4.  Choose *Create*.

    A wizard opens that helps you create your instance.

    > ### Tip:  
    > To see a list of all instances that have already been created in your subaccount, choose *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions* from the navigation area. Here, you can also create a new ABAP environment instance.

5.  Select the `standard` service plan.

6.  Choose *Cloud Foundry* as your runtime environment.

7.  Select a space.

8.  Enter a CLI-friendly instance name, and choose *Next*.

    The instance name identifies the service instance in the Cloud Foundry environment. Specify an instance name that is unique among all the service instances in a space and only contains alphanumeric characters \(A-Z, a-z\), periods, underscores, and hyphens.

9.  Provide additional instance parameters for the configuration by either using the default **form** or by uploading a **JSON file** from your computer or by specifying the parameters in JSON format.

    > ### Note:  
    > The admin email address is used to create the initial user for the ABAP system automatically, including the assignment of the administrator role to this user. You can access the ABAP environment system only with this specified user. By default, the email address is used as subject name identifier.
    > 
    > Using email address as subject name identifier might not be possible if e-mail addresses is ambiguous across users or the trusted identiy provider configured for authentication in the ABAP Environment instanceâ€™s subaccount already is configured with subject name identifier Login Name. You can then change login\_attribute to user\_name via the parameter and in addition also provide the user name for the initial user in parameter admin\_user\_name.
    > 
    > The ABAP system description is optional.
    > 
    > The Development System checkbox is checked by default. By using this setting, you can control the changeability of development objects in the system. If you want to protect all your customer-related software components and ABAP namespaces against manual changes via ABAP Development Tools, uncheck the box. This setting is used for test and productive systems, where changes must be imported only. For information about which business catalogs are available in development systems only, see [Business Catalogs for Development Tasks](../50-administration-and-ops/business-catalogs-for-development-tasks-a9f4278.md).
    > 
    > The ABAP system ID must consist of exactly three alphanumeric characters. Only uppercase letters are allowed. The first character must be a letter \(not a digit\). The ID does not have to be technically unique.
    > 
    > The ABAP runtime size \(parameter `size_of_runtime`\) refers to the size of the ABAP runtime. It's part of the quota plan *abap\_compute\_unit*, with one ABAP compute unit representing 16 GB. The supported number of abap\_compute\_unit is 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, 24, or 32. For more information, see [ABAP Compute Units](../50-administration-and-ops/abap-compute-units-7d1caa8.md).
    > 
    > The HANA memory size \(parameter `size_of_persistence`\) refers to the size of SAP HANA memory. It's part of the quota plan *hana\_compute\_unit*, with one HANA compute unit representing the suitable block size for the underlying SAP HANA Cloud instance \(15 GB on AWS or 16 GB on Microsoft Azure\). The supported number of hana\_compute\_unit per HANA instance is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64.
    > 
    > The size of persistence disk \(parameter `size_of_persistence_disk` refers to the size of the SAP HANA Cloud storage in GB. If the parameter is set to `auto`, the SAP HANA Cloud storage size is set to the minimal value 40 \* size\_of\_persistence + 40. The maximum allowed value is 120 \* size\_of\_persistence + 40. If you set a higher value, it will consume 0.002 HANA compute units \(HCU\) for any GB exceeding the minimal default size of the persistence disk. Therefore, the HCU ratio of additional storage disk to RAM is 1 : 33.33 per GB on AWS \(as 1 HCU = 15 GB\) and 1 : 31.25 per GB on Microsoft Azure \(as 1 HCU = 16 GB\).
    > 
    > Make sure that you don't choose more compute units than you have assigned to your subaccount for the ABAP environment \(see [Increasing the Quota for the ABAP Environment](increasing-the-quota-for-the-abap-environment-c40cb18.md)\).
    > 
    > For more information about ABAP system sizing and Native Storage Extension for selected SAP HANA tables, see [ABAP System Sizing](../50-administration-and-ops/abap-system-sizing-90b515d.md) and [Native Storage Extension for the ABAP Environment](../50-administration-and-ops/native-storage-extension-for-the-abap-environment-68eb2a0.md).

    > ### Caution:  
    > Be aware that not all parameters can be changed if you update your ABAP system. For a list of updatable parameters, see [Updating an ABAP System](updating-an-abap-system-7890ffa.md).

10. Choose *Next* to review and verify your instance details.

11. Choose *Create*.

    The ABAP environment instance is being set up, which might take a while. Wait for an email that is sent when the setup is completed and the system up and running. The email is sent to the email address that you specified as admin email in the previous steps.

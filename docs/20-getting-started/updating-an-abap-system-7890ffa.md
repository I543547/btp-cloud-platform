# Updating an ABAP System

Learn how to update your ABAP environment instance.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> After you have created an ABAP environment instance, you can change the following properties:
> 
> -   ABAP System Description
> 
> -   ABAP Runtime Size
> 
> -   HANA Memory Size
> 
> -   Size of Persistence Disk
> 
> 
> To change the initial admin, you have to use the *Maintain Employees* SAP Fiori app. See [Maintain Employees](../50-administration-and-ops/maintain-employees-e882b0f.md).

> ### Restriction:  
> The HANA memory size can currently only be increased, and not yet decreased.



## Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, choose your Cloud Foundry subaccount and navigate to the space, in which you have created your ABAP environment instance. See [Navigate in the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/0874895f1f78459f9517da55a11ffebd.html).

2.  From the navigation area, choose *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions*.

    You see a list of all instances that have been created.

3.  Select your *ABAP environment* instance and choose *Update* by clicking on <span class="SAP-icons">î‡²</span> at the end of the row. If you'd like to check the values that are currently configured first, please select *View Parameters* instead.

4.  In the *Update Instance* wizard, you can update the parameters listed above. See [Increasing the Quota for the ABAP Environment](increasing-the-quota-for-the-abap-environment-c40cb18.md).

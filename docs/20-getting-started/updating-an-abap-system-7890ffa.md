# Updating an ABAP System

Learn how to update your ABAP environment instance.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> After you have created an ABAP environment instance, you can change the following properties:
> 
> -   ABAP System Description
> 
> -   ABAP Runtime Size \(size\_of\_runtime\)
> 
> -   Elastic Scaling of the ABAP Application Server
> 
> -   HANA Cloud Memory Size \(size\_of\_persistence\)
> 
> -   HANA Cloud Disk Size \(size\_of\_persistence\_disk\)
> 
> 
> > ### Note:  
> > The updates of these properties are done without any downtime, or - in case of updating the HANA memory or disk size - with near zero downtime \(meaning that the database is not accessible for a few seconds only\).
> 
> To change the initial admin, you have to use the *Maintain Employees* SAP Fiori app. See [Maintain Employees](../50-administration-and-ops/maintain-employees-e882b0f.md).

> ### Restriction:  
> A downsizing of the HANA Cloud memory size is only possible down to the minimum amount of memory required for a stable performance of the HANA Cloud database. Before the memory size is decreased, an SQL query \(as described on [SAP HANA Database Downsizing](https://help.sap.com/docs/hana-cloud/sap-hana-cloud-administration-guide/sap-hana-database-downsizing)\) is automatically run on the database to make sure the downsizing is possible based on the already consumed memory.
> 
> The HANA Cloud memory size cannot be decreased while a system is stopped. To decrease the HANA Cloud memory size of a stopped instance, the instance has to be started via the `Landscape Portal` first.
> 
> The HANA Cloud disk size can currently only be increased, and not decreased.
> 
> Both the HANA Cloud memory and the disk size can only be resized once every 24 hours.



## Procedure

1.  In the SAP BTP cockpit, choose your Cloud Foundry subaccount and navigate to the space, in which you have created your ABAP environment instance. See [Navigate in the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/products/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/0874895f1f78459f9517da55a11ffebd.html).

2.  From the navigation area, choose *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions*.

    You see a list of all instances that have been created.

3.  Select your *ABAP environment* instance and choose *Update* by clicking on <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î‡²</span> at the end of the row. If you'd like to check the values that are currently configured first, please select *View Parameters* instead.

4.  In the *Update Instance* wizard, you can update the parameters listed above. See [Increasing the Quota for the ABAP Environment](increasing-the-quota-for-the-abap-environment-c40cb18.md).

5.  In the *Update Instance* wizard, you can keep values that you don't want to change on '-1' or 'auto'.

6.  Choose *Update Instance* to save your changes.

# ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model



The [ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/abap-restful-application-programming-model?version=sap_btp) defines the architecture for efficient end-to-end development of intrinsically SAP HANA-optimized OData services \(such as SAP Fiori apps\) in the ABAP environment. It supports the development of all types of Fiori applications as well as publishing Web APIs. It is based on technologies and frameworks such as Core Data Services \(CDS\) for defining semantically rich data models and a service model infrastructure for creating OData services with bindings to an OData protocol and ABAP-based application services for custom logic and SAPUI5-based user interfaces.

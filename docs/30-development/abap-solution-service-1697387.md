ABAP Solution Service is used to enable multitenancy for ABAP Environment systems: Instead of creating the ABAP system manually it is created by the ABAP Solution service during the first subscription of an application consumer or once the consumer tenant limit for all viable systems has been reached.

Credentials provided in the ASP\_CC destination are used by ABAP Solution Service to authenticate at the Cloud Foundry Cloud Controller API endpoint and to create required ABAP service instances.

The service plan used for created ABAP service instances is depending on the `addon_product_name` parameter: `abap/standard` is used for a system without add-on, `abap/saas_oem` is used for a system with installed add-on. Provisioning parameters like `sap_system_name`, `provider_admin_email` and sizing-relevant parameters can be defined.

After a new system is created, a tenant for the application consumer is provisioned. The business type \(see [Tenant Business Types](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/60f1b283f0fd4d0aa7b3f8cea4d73d1d/018e8bd109d64140ade5429c3a9dbef0.html?state=DRAFT&version=Internal)\) used for provisioning of the tenant depends on the `usage` parameter: In case of `usage = test`, the tenant is created as `Partner Customer Test` tenant. Whereas with `usage = prod`, the tenant is created as `Partner Customer Production` tenant. Parameter `tenant_mode` controls if per subscription a new tenant is created in the same system and with `consumer_tenant_limit` the number of tenants per system is configured.



### ABAP System: saas\_oem plan

This service plan is like the standard service plan of the ABAP service \(see [Create an ABAP System](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/60f1b283f0fd4d0aa7b3f8cea4d73d1d/50b32f144e184154987a06e4b55ce447.html?state=DRAFT&version=Internal&q=create%20an%20abap%20system)\), but it is used as "backing service" for a partner-provided SaaS solution. In comparison to a standard service plan of the ABAP service, there is one main differences: An add-on product \(see [The Add-on product](https://www.project-piper.io/scenarios/abapEnvironmentAddons/#the-add-on-product)\) which is installed during system provisioning can be specified.

-   Parameter: `addon_product_name`

    \(specifies which ABAP add-on to install during provisioning\)

-   Parameter: `addon_product_version`

    \(if - for testing purpose - another add-on version instead of the most recent released version shall be installed\)

## Prerequisites

You need an administration role to be able to create application jobs.

You must set up a communication arrangement based on communication scenario `SAP_COM_0527`, so that metrics stored in the generic metric store are automatically pushed to Health Monitoring in SAP Cloud ALM and SAP Focused Run.



## Procedure

1.  In the SAP Fiori launchpad, open the *Schedule Metric Provider Collection* app.

2.  Choose *Create* to create a new application job.

    The job template for collecting metric provider values is already selected.

3.  To change job settings, follow the instructions of the in-built documentation of SAP Companion.

    > ### Note:  
    > Enter a recurrence that is a multiple of 5 minutes. **Don't** use a recurrence pattern that's shorter than 5 minutes.

4.  Schedule the job.

    > ### Note:  
    > Make sure that you schedule this job for the development system and all follow-up systems.

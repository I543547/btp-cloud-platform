[Installing Remote Stubs](installing-remote-stubs-4925612.md "During ATC execution, the central check system accesses the systems in your landscape remotely through so-called remote stubs using RFC connection. Thus, remote stubs serve as an interface between the central check system and on-premise systems; they return a model of custom code that needs to be checked.")

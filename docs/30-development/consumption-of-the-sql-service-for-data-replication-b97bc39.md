# Consumption of the SQL Service for Data Replication

Learn how you can set up SAP Datasphere as a client for replicating data.

After you have created and exposed an SQL service for data replication \(see [Creating a Communication Arrangement for Exposing the SQL Service](creating-a-communication-arrangement-for-exposing-the-sql-service-167b9ba.md)\), create a communication arrangement for SAP Datasphere to be able to reach the ABAP system. In addition, create a replication flow in SAP Datasphere to connect the ABAP source system with the envisioned target environment.

After the objects exposed using the SQL service have been selected and deployed in the replication flow, you can access the replicated data in SAP Datasphere for further processing and combining it with data from other data sources.

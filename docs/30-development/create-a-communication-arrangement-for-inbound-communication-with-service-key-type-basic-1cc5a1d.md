## Prerequisites

-   You have created a communication scenario.
-   You have created a space. See [Create Spaces](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/2f6ed22ccf424dae84345f4500c2d8ea.html).
-   You have the space developer role. See [Assigning the Space Developer Role to the Developer Users](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a96b1df8525f41f79484717368e30626/Cloud/en-US/967fc4e2b1314cf7afc7d7043b53e566.html).



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the cockpit and go to the subaccount that contains the space you'd like to navigate to. See [Navigate in the Cockpit](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/0874895f1f78459f9517da55a11ffebd.html).

2.  In the navigation area, go to *Cloud Foundry* \> *Spaces* and choose your space.

3.  Select *Services* \> *Instances* from the navigation area and find your ABAP system service instance.

4.  Click on <span class="SAP-icons-V5">î‡²</span>and select *Create Service Key*.

5.  In the *New Service Key* dialog, enter a name for your service key and specify the parameters in JSON format as follows:

    ```
    {
       "scenario_id":"SAP_COM_XYZ",
       "type":"basic"
    }
    
    ```

    > ### Note:  
    > `SAP_COM_XYZ` is the ID of the communication scenario in your ABAP system.
    > 
    > `basic` is the type of service key that is needed to generate a communication user and communication arrangement for an inbound communication scenario.

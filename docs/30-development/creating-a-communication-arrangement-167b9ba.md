# Creating a Communication Arrangement



## Context

As a last step of the back-end configuration for exposing an SQL service in the ABAP system, an administrator must create a communication arrangement. The arrangement links the communication scenario that was created in ABAP Development Tools with the communication system and communication user.



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the SAP Fiori launchpad of the ABAP environment as an administrator.

2.  In the SAP Fiori launchpad, under *Communication Management*, choose *Communication Arrangements*.

3.  Choose *New*.

4.  In the following popup, enter the communication scenario that you created before and choose *Create*.

5.  In the newly created communication arrangement, enter the communication system that you created before \(see [Creating a Communication System and a Communication User](creating-a-communication-system-and-a-communication-user-28881fb.md)\).

    This step completes the link between communication scenario and communication system. The system automatically adds the communication user.

6.  Take note of the service URL.

    Itâ€™s something like https://<hostname\>/sap/bc/sql/sql1/sap/S\_PRIVILEGED.

7.  Choose *Save*.

You've now finished all preparation tasks in the ABAP system and can access the exposed objects as an SQL service.

2.  Under *Communication Management*, choose the *Communication Systems* app.

3.  Choose *New*, enter a system ID and name for the communication system, and choose *Create*.

4.  In the newly created communication system, select the checkbox *Inbound Only*.

5.  Under *Users for Inbound Communication*, choose the *\+* button and then *New User*.

6.  Enter a user name \(for example, `SQL_CLIENT_USER`\), a description, and a password.

    Remember the user name and password for later.

7.  Choose *Create*.

8.  To add the new user to the communication system, choose *OK* in the dialog.

    The user is now listed in the screen area *Users for Inbound Communication*.

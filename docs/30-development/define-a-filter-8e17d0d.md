# Define a Filter

If one or more application logs shall be read from the database and if the log handles are not known, you can identify the logs by defining a filter.

To create a filter, an instance of interface `IF_BALI_LOG_FILTER` is required. To create this instance, you can use method `CREATE` of class `CL_BALI_LOG_FILTER`. It creates an empty filter.

> ### Note:  
> Due to performance reasons, we recommend to set at least the object and subobject in the filter.

Interface `IF_BALI_LOG_FILTER` contains the following methods to set the filter parameters:

-   SET\_DESCRIPTOR: Set a filter for the log object, subobject and external identifier. It offers the following parameters:

    -   Select a single object

    -   Select a single subobject \(wildcards allowed\)

    -   Select a table of subobjects \(wildcards allowed\)

    -   Select a single external identifier \(wildcards allowed\)

    -   Select a table of external identifiers \(wildcards allowed\)


-   SET\_CREATE\_INFO: Set a filter for the attribute which identifies the creator of the log. It offers the following parameters:

    -   Select a single user \(wildcards allowed\)

    -   Select a table of users \(wildcards allowed\)


-   SET\_TIME\_INTERVAL: Set a time interval for the creation date and time of the log. The start and end time of the interval are set using UTC time stamps.

-   SET\_MAXIMUM\_LOG\_NUMBER: Set the maximum number of logs which shall be read from the database. If the parameter is not set, all logs are read \(which fulfill the other filter criteria\).


> ### Example:  
> Set a filter which selects up to 5 logs which were created in the last hour by the current user:

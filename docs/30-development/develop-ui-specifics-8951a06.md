# Develop UI-Specifics

The UI layout of a *Business Configuration Maintenance Object* in the *Custom Business Configurations* app depends on the following layers.

-   [CDS Annotations](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/developing-ready-to-run-business-object?version=sap_btp)


You can use CDS annotations to define, among other things, the field labels and description, value helps, facets and actions.

-   Fiori Elements Settings in the [Business Configuration Maintenance Object definition](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/developing-ready-to-run-business-object?version=sap_btp)


You can configure the list report, object pages and table settings of the *Fiori Elements List Report Floor Plan*rendered by the *Custom Business Configurations* app.

-   Generic UI functions of the [Custom Business Configurations App](../50-administration-and-ops/custom-business-configurations-app-76384d8.md).


Grouping of business configuration maintenance objects, intent navigation, display change logs and show documentation are generic UI functions of the *Custom Business Configurations*app.

# Developing Business Applications Using Java

The CAP Java SDK enables developing SAP Cloud Application Programming Model \(CAP\) applications in Java. While the SAP Business Application Studio provides excellent support to develop CAP Java applications, you can also develop locally with your tool of choice, for example Eclipse.

The CAP Java SDK supports lean application design by its modular architecture, that means you pick the required features and add them to your application dependencies on demand.

It enables local development by supporting in-memory or file-based SQLite databases. At the same time, the CAP Java SDK enables switching to a productive environment, using, for example, SAP HANA as a database, easily by simply switching the application deployment configuration.

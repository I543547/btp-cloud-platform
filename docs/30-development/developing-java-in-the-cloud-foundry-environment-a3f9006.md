SAP Java Buildpack is a Cloud Foundry buildpack for running JVM-based applications. The buildpack provides the following runtimes: [Tomcat](tomcat-ddfc101.md), [TomEE \(Deprecated\)](tomee-deprecated-a9590c2.md), [TomEE 7](tomee-7-79c039a.md), and [Java Main](java-main-8a1786a.md).

## Usage

To use this buildpack, specify its name when pushing an application to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry:

```
cf push -f <PATH_TO_APP_MANIFEST> -b sap_java_buildpack
```

You can also use the buildpack attribute to specify it in the `manifest.yml` file:

```
---
applications:
- name: <APP_NAME>
  buildpacks:
  - sap_java_buildpack
  ...
```

or in the `mtad.yml` file of your archive:

```
...
modules:
  - name: <APP_NAME>
    type: java.tomcat
    path: <path_to_archive>
    properties:
      ...
    parameters:
      ...
      memory: 512M
      buildpack: sap_java_buildpack
...
```

## Buildpack Versioning

The SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment provides four versions of SAP Java Buildpack as part of its system buildpacks:

-   *sap\_java\_buildpack* - Holds the latest available version of SAP Java Buildpack. All new features and fixes are provided with this version.

-   *sap\_java\_buildpack\_<version\_latest\>* - Holds the latest available version of SAP Java Buildpack; available for a limited timeframe \(4 to 6 weeks\).

-   *sap\_java\_buildpack\_<version\_previous\>* - This version used to be latest in the previous update of the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry environment; available for a limited timeframe \(4 to 6 weeks\).

-   *sap\_java\_buildpack\_<version\_before\_previous\>* - This version used to be latest before two updates of the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry; available for a limited timeframe \(4 to 6 weeks\).


To check these versions:

1.  Log in to a particular SAP BTP region and subaccount. Run: **`cf api <SAP BTP region>`**

    For example: **`cf api https://api.cf.eu10.hana.ondemand.com`**

2.  Then run: **`cf buildpacks`**




### How to use the SAP Java Buildpack versions?

-   Use the default **sap\_java\_buildpack** – You take advantage of all latest features and fixes in SAP Java Buildpack. This way, it's guaranteed that the buildpack is always available. The drawback in this case is the limited time for any adoption which might be needed. In such a scenario, applications can fall back to an older version temporarily to avoid any downtime.

-   Set a particular version of the buildpack - Bear in mind that this version will exist for a limited amount of time. This may lead to the situation where application restage is failing because the used version of the buildpack is no longer available. To avoid this, we recommend that you follow the updates of the buildpack and test your applications with the latest buildpack version. Developers should never allow their applications to run on an outdated buildpack version.


**Example:**

Let's say that the latest version of SAP Java Buildpack is **1.80.0**. Then, the output of the `cf buildpacks` command would be:

```
buildpack           position   enabled   locked   filename

sap_java_buildpack           1         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-1.80.0.zip
sap_java_buildpack_1_80      2         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-1.80.0.zip
sap_java_buildpack_1_79      3         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-1.79.0.zip
sap_java_buildpack_1_78      4         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-1.78.0.zip
```

When SAP Java Buildpack is updated on the SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry from version **1.80.0** to **1.81.0**, the list will change to:

```
buildpack           position   enabled   locked   filename

sap_java_buildpack           1         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-1.81.0.zip
sap_java_buildpack_1_81      2         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-1.81.0.zip
sap_java_buildpack_1_80      3         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-1.80.0.zip
sap_java_buildpack_1_79      4         true      false    sap_java_buildpack-1.79.0.zip
```

This means that *sap\_java\_buildpack\_1\_78* will no longer be available for applications.

> ### Note:  
> No fixes will be provided to older versions of the buildpack. Fixes, including security ones, will be part of the latest version.



### Switching to a different version of the buildpack

To use *sap\_java\_buildpack\_<version\_suffix\>*, specify its name when pushing an application to SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry:

```
cf push -f <PATH_TO_APP_MANIFEST> -b sap_java_buildpack_<version_suffix>
```

Alternatively, you can specify the buildpack in the `manifest.yml` file.

For example:

```
---
applications:
- name: myapp
  memory: 128M
  path: ./target/myapp.war
  instances: 1
  buildpacks:
  - sap_java_buildpack_1_80
```

You can do the same in the `mtad.yml` of your **mtar** archive:

```
...
modules:
  - name: myapp
    type: java.tomcat
    path: ./target/myapp.war
    properties:
      ...
    parameters:
      ...
      memory: 512M
      buildpack: sap_java_buildpack_1_80
...
```

## Async Servlets

In the current version of the SAP Java Buildpack, the async servlets are *not supported*.

**Reason:** Some of the [valves](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/valve.html) that SAP Java Buildpack brings to Tomcat and TomEE 7 are not "async enabled".

### SAP Business Application Studio

Use the SAP Business Application Studio to develop on Cloud Foundry. You just need to create a dev space, which is a preconfigured development environment with the tools, capabilities, and resources needed for developing your application.

1.  Register for an SAP BTP trial account at [https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/](https://account.hanatrial.ondemand.com/) and log on afterwards.

2.  [Set Up SAP Business Application Studio in a trial account.](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/sap-business-application-studio/getting-started-with-trial-account?version=Cloud)

3.  [Create a SAP Fiori dev space.](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/sap-business-application-studio/sap-fiori?version=Cloud)
4.  [Create a Project - either using the wizard or the terminal.](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/sap-business-application-studio/create-project?version=Cloud)


[Learn how you can use SAP Business Application Studio together with UI5 Tooling to develop state-of-the-art UI5 apps.](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/#/topic/6bbad66475d040f39df6fbbaabe6f40f.html)



### Tutorials

Depending on the project template you're using you have a project that is more advanced than what you see in the following tutorials. Those tutorials show you the basics and you can start a new and empty project to follow along those SAPUI5 tutorials from the demo kit.

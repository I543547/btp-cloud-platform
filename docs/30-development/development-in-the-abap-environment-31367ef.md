# Development in the ABAP Environment

Learn more about developing applications in the ABAP environment.



## Overview

The ABAP environment is a platform as a service that allows you to extend existing ABAP-based applications and develop ABAP cloud apps decoupled from the digital core. You can leverage your ABAP know-how in the cloud and reuse existing ABAP assets by writing your source code with ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse.

The ABAP environment enables you to **expose**:

-   OData services. See [ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model](https://help.sap.com/docs/abap-cloud/abap-rap/abap-restful-application-programming-model?version=sap_btp).

-   HTTP services. See [Working with the HTTP Service Editor](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/Cloud/en-US/494a02697388437aa71067dd95b2c561.html).
-   SQL services. See [Consumption of the SQL Service and the ODBC Driver for ABAP](consumption-of-the-sql-service-and-the-odbc-driver-for-abap-6ac9ec8.md).
-   RFC function modules. See [Develop a Remote-Enabled Function Module \(RFM\)](develop-a-remote-enabled-function-module-rfm-abf7105.md).

With your ABAP applications, you can **consume**:

-   HTTP services \(HTTP client\). See [Set Up HTTP Communication](set-up-http-communication-3884bc3.md).

-   OData services \(service consumption model\). See [Developing a UI Service with Access to a Remote Service](https://help.sap.com/viewer/923180ddb98240829d935862025004d6/Cloud/en-US/f4969e551d3049c59715210cbeb4ef56.html).
-   Remote Function Calls \(RFC\). See [Set Up RFC Communication](set-up-rfc-communication-b4eaa0a.md).
-   On-premise systems via Cloud Connector. See [Integrating On-Premise Systems](integrating-on-premise-systems-c95327f.md).
-   SOAP-based Web services. See [Set Up SOAP Communication](set-up-soap-communication-8b6723b.md).

## Role Assignment Recommendations

-   Assign the `SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR_DANA` role to a business user who does not have the `SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR` role.
-   Make sure that the user with the `SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR_DANA` role is assigned to a single copy of the `SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR_DANA` role. Assigning the user to multiple copies of the `SAP_BR_ADMINISTRATOR_DANA` role may cause authorization issues when you access the Customer Data Browser app.

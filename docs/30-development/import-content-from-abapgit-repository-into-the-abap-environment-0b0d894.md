<a name="loio0b0d89476cb54fceb552732611cb881c__prereq_pcn_qqc_fhb"/>

## Prerequisites

-   You have installed the abapGit repositories ADT plug-in. See [https://eclipse.abapgit.org/updatesite/](https://eclipse.abapgit.org/updatesite/).
-   You have created content in your on-premise system and pushed it to your abapGit repository. See [Create Content in an On-Premise System and Push it to abapGit Repository](create-content-in-an-on-premise-system-and-push-it-to-abapgit-repository-2af08ee.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > The repository has to be accessible from the Internet. Cloud Connector is not supported.

-   You have access to an ABAP cloud system. See [Creating an ABAP System](../20-getting-started/creating-an-abap-system-50b32f1.md).
-   You have assigned a developer user in the ABAP environment to the developer role. See [Assigning the ABAP Developer User to the ABAP Developer Role](../20-getting-started/assigning-the-abap-developer-user-to-the-abap-developer-role-13b2cfb.md).

> ### Restriction:  
> Please note that abapGit is an open-source project owned by the community. Therefore, we do not provide support for abapGit. We only support the abapGit integration in the ABAP environment.



## Procedure

1.  Log on to ABAP Development Tools in Eclipse.

2.  In the *Project Explorer*, select your cloud project system, and navigate to *Window* \> *Show View* \> *Other..* to open the abapGit repositories view.

3.  Search for *ABAP*, choose *abapGit Repositories*, and select *Open*.

4.  In the *abapGit repositories view*, select the clone button \(green + icon\).

5.  Enter your abapGit repository URL, and select *Next*.

6.  Select a *Branch* and *Package*, where you want your abapGit repository to be cloned, and confirm with *Next*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If there are no packages, you have to create a structure package and add a development package.

7.  Select the default transport request, and choose *Finish*.

    The imported objects are displayed in your package. See [Released ABAP Object Types](released-abap-object-types-b31aa03.md).

    > ### Note:  
    > The number of imported objects can differ from the number of exported objects because only released ABAP object types are considered during the import.

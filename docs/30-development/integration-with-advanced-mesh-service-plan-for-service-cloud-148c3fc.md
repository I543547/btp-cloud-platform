# Integration with Advanced Mesh Service Plan for Service Cloud

With the SAP Event Mesh Advanced Plan, you can connect directly to your own SAP AEM instance. You can use SAP Event Mesh Advanced Plan for very large projects, where performance is crucial.

If you have a valid subscription to the SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh, you can use the Virtual Message Router \(VMR\) endpoint of SAP AEM broker obtained from the SAP AEM Console UI. The SAP AEM's validation service then only checks if a valid SAP AEM broker instance is available. If a valid SAP AEM instance is available, a direct connection to this instance is established.

This section describes the integration of the enterprise event enablement with the communication scenarios *SAP Advanced Event Mesh Integration* \(SAP\_COM\_0492\) and *SAP Advanced Event Mesh Validation Service Integration* \(SAP\_COM\_0493\).

The communication scenario SAP\_COM\_0492 is the prerequisite for SAP\_COM\_0493. To integrate with the SAP Advanced Event Mesh service, you need to create both the scenarios.

For the integration of an ABAP Platform Cloud tenant, you require a subscription to the SAP Advanced Event Mesh service and to the SAP AEM Validation service.

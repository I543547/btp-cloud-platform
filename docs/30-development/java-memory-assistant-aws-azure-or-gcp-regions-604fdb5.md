Java Memory Assistant is a Java agent that generates heap dumps based on preconfigured conditions in the memory usage of the application. See: [Java Memory Assistant](https://github.com/SAP/java-memory-assistant)

> ### Note:  
> This public repository went out of maintenance on **Sept 21, 2023**. Nevertheless, its latest version [0.5.0](https://github.com/SAP-archive/java-memory-assistant/releases/tag/0.5.0) is working fine so you can keep using it.

When enabled in the buildpack, the agent generates two files â€“ **\*.hprof** \(heap dump\) and **\*.addons**, when the configured memory limits are met.

The **\*.addons** file contains:

-   Command-line parameters

-   Implemented interfaces for the classes

-   Information \(name\) about transient fields for the classes

-   Class and metaspace statistics

-   Stack traces of the last OOM errors

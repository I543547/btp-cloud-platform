# Publish Product

You, as a provider, have developed a product that you want to make available to your customers as an add-on that they can install into their system to be used directly or as part of the system software. You can use the Publish Product app to publish your product in a specific version for use by one of your customers or by all Landscape Portal customers. Your customer can then use the [Register External Product](register-external-product-b90f70d.md) app to view all product versions that were published, i.e. made available, for them and can choose to accept a registration, thus adding a product to their pool of available products.

Hereâ€™s how to publish a product version for use by customers.

1.  Log into the *Landscape Portal*.
2.  In the *Product Lifecycle Management* section, click on the *Publish Product* tile to open the app.
3.  To publish a product version: click *Create*. Fill in the information. You can choose to enter the customer ERP ID of one specific customer, or you can tick the box next to it to make the product available to all customers.

    To edit a published product version: Select the product version and click *Edit*. Note that the product name, product version, customer ERP ID and customer name cannot be edited.

    To unpublish a published product version: Select the product version and click *Delete*. The entry will be removed from the table. Customers will see the product's status turn to "Unpublished" in the [Register External Product](register-external-product-b90f70d.md) app. They will no longer be able to install the product. Existing installations will not be affected.


Your customer\(s\) can now use the [Register External Product](register-external-product-b90f70d.md) app to accept the registration and thus add your product version to their pool of available product versions.

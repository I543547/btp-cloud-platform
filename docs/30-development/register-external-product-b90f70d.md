# Register External Product

You want to be able to install a provider's product into your system to be used directly or as part of the system software. The provider has made their product available to you using the [Publish Product](publish-product-55d19e4.md) app. To accept this external product and add it to your pool of available products, you can use the *Register External Product* app.

Here's how to register for an external product that has been published for you.

1.  Log into the *Landscape Portal*.
2.  In the *Product Installation* section, click on the *Register External Product* tile to open the app. Here, you can view a table of all external products that have been published for you.
3.  To register for a product, select it from the list and click the *Register* button. The product has now been added to your pool of available products.

    To unregister for a product, simply select it and click the*Unregister* button.


Once you've registered for a product, you can deploy it to a specific ABAP system using the [Deploy Product](deploy-product-32c4f7d.md) app.

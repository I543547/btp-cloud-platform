# Runtime API

Use a class-based API to create and read application logs.

You can use a class-based API to create and read application logs. The application log is a tool for collecting messages or exceptions which are stored in a log. You can save this log in the database or read and delete it from there.

If an application wants to collect messages and exceptions which occur during runtime of an application program, the following steps are required:

-   [Create a New Application Log](create-a-new-application-log-f7c20f7.md)

-   [Set Header Information](set-header-information-b962eb9.md)

-   [Add Items](add-items-31f564e.md)

-   [Writing Application Logs to the Database](writing-application-logs-to-the-database-d15d974.md)


If an application wants to read the content of an application log from the database, for example, to display its content, the following steps are required:

-   [Define a Filter](define-a-filter-8e17d0d.md)

-   [Read Application Logs from the Database](read-application-logs-from-the-database-4ed3b27.md)

-   [Get Header Information from the Log](get-header-information-from-the-log-9572409.md)

-   [Get Items from the Log](get-items-from-the-log-c4783e6.md)

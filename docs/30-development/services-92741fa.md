# services

Specify options for a service in your application.



The services section in `xs-app.json` extends the services configuration in the deployment manifest \(`manifest.yml`\), for example, with some static properties such as an end point.

> ### Sample Code:  
> ```
> {
>   "services": {
>     "com.sap.appbasic.country": {
>       "endpoint": "countryservice",
>       "logoutPath": "/countrieslogout",
>       "logoutMethod": "GET"
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```

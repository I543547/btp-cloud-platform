# Sizing Guide

This guide explains how much application runtime you must purchase to run HTML5 applications.

To develop and run HTML5 Applications using a standalone approuter on Cloud Foundry, customers must purchase the application runtime.

The most important point that affects the required application runtime is concurrent users, which is the number of expected users that log in to the system at the same time \(during peak times\).

Using the following table, estimate how much application runtime allocation you need, based on t-shirt sizes and the expected number of concurrent users.

# Stop a System



You want to put a system into hibernation immediately. This will cause the system to shut down all connection, remove the application servers and halt the database. Users that are currently logged in will have their sessions be closed.

Here's how it's done.

1.  Log into the *Landscape Portal*.
2.  In the *Systems* section, click on the*Manage System Hibernation* tile to open the app.
3.  On the left side, under *Systems*, you can see a list of all your systems, as well as their current status \(*Live* or *Stopped*\). *Live* systems are currently active, *Stopped* systems are in hibernation. You can also see if a system is currently in the process of *Stopping* or *Starting*.
4.  Select one or more systems with status *Live* that you want to put into hibernation, then click the *Stop* button at the top.

    > ### Note:  
    > The button will only be enabled if all selected systems can be stopped.

5.  A pop-up window will open, asking you to confirm your choice. Confirm your choice by clicking *OK*.

The selected system\(s\) will now be put into hibernation.

> ### Note:  
> Note that it might take a few minutes for the system to stop.
> 
> Note that a stopped system doesn't process any regular or event-driven business tasks. The system must explicitly be started again to process these tasks.

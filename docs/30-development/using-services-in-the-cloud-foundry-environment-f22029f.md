## SAP Service Manager

You can also access services for the Cloud Foundry environment through SAP Service Manager, the central registry for service brokers and platforms. Itâ€™s tightly integrated with SAP BTP and allows you to consume services in connected runtime environments and to manage platforms, service brokers, service instances, and service bindings.

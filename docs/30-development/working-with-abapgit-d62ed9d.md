# Working with abapGit

abapGit is an open source developed Git client for the ABAP server to import and export ABAP objects between ABAP systems.

With abapGit, you can export your ABAP objects from any system to another, typically from on-premise to cloud or from one cloud system to another. See [Use abapGit to Transfer Your On-Premise ABAP Source Code to the Cloud](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-abapgit.html) and [Push Your ABAP Source Code from SAP BTP, ABAP Environment to a GitHub Repository Using abapGit](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/abap-environment-abapgit-transfer.html).

> ### Note:  
> While the ABAP environment comes with a preinstalled cloud version of abapGit, you can only use abapGit in an on-premise system if you have installed the [official community version](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit) of abapGit. However, the official community version is not supported by SAP.

With the official SAP distribution of abapGit, you can use ABAP Development Tools \(ADT\) in combination with the abapGit feature for ADT, which allows easier access to the import/export functionality provided by abapGit. For more information on how to install and work with ABAP Development Tools, see [Installing ABAP Development Tools](https://help.sap.com/doc/2e9cf4a457d84c7a81f33d8c3fdd9694/Cloud/en-US/inst_guide_abap_development_tools.pdf) and [abapGit Repositories ADT Plug-In](https://eclipse.abapgit.org/updatesite/).

## Restrictions and Errors

There are certain restrictions to the export and import functionality when using abapGit in the ABAP environment. This is due to the cloud-optimized set of supported ABAP object types that change with each release as new ABAP object types are added continuously. See [Released ABAP Object Types](released-abap-object-types-b31aa03.md). Depending on your application, you may face the following issues when using abapGit in cloud systems:

-   Export errors when pushing unsupported objects
-   Import errors when pulling unsupported objects
-   Activation errors when activating imported objects



### Export Errors

If you try to export objects that are not supported, you receive a warning during the push operation, and the unreleased object is skipped.

The only work-around for this is to manually copy the missing ABAP objects to the target system. First, you have to create these objects using the same name in the target system. Afterwards, you either have to manually copy the code or reconfigure the objects in the target system.

Some objects are deliberately not exported because they are considered as compiled or generated so that they can be regenerated when activating their originating objects in the target system. For example, certain service definitions \(SRVD\) are generated from service consumption models \(SRVC\) so that they are not exported to git.

**UI Artifacts**

The same reasoning regarding compiled/generated objects currently also applies to UI/SAP Fiori artifacts \(SMIM, UIAD, WAPA\). Originating UI objects have their own lifecycle in SAP Business Application Studio and therefore have to be deployed separately to the target ABAP system via SAP Business Application Studio using SAP Fiori Tools, see [Generate Deployment Configuration ABAP](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_FIORI_tools/17d50220bcd848aa854c9c182d65b699/c06b9cbb3f3641aabfe3a5d199e855a0.html). If the deployment target is in a different global account, you have to push the UI project to a Git repository using SAP Business Application Studio as described in [Git Source Control](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/9689c07b64364bbea43725dad9f27320.html). After the initial deployment of the UI to the target ABAP development system, the generated artifacts follow the same transport lifecycle from development to test and production systems as all the other artifacts.



### Import Errors

When importing objects with abapGit for ADT, you may get error messages in the import log. Possible reasons can be:

-   You are importing object types \(for example from an on-premise system\) that are not supported in the ABAP environment and the programming model of the ABAP environment. You may have to change your application in the cloud environment to work without these objects.
-   You are importing objects with missing dependencies. These dependent objects can't be exported because they are not on the list of Released ABAP Object Types. You must copy/recreate these missing dependent objects and restart the import.
-   You are importing objects using ABAP namespaces. Make sure these namespaces have been imported into the target system before importing your application with abapGit.

> ### Note:  
> Local changes to ABAP objects that have not been saved are overwritten by the import. Open transport requests for any of the imported ABAP objects must be released before they can be changed. Otherwise, they get locked.



### Activation Errors

All objects imported with abapGit are imported in an inactive state, except the ones that do not offer an inactive state, to ensure that their consistency can be properly checked during activation. Hence, you have to activate all imported objects after importing them so that ABAP activation can verify that only released APIs have been used.

During the activation process, some objects may depend on other objects, which need to be activated beforehand. However, not all object types consider the objects they depend on during mass activation. For example:

-   Data dictionary \(DDic\) and core data service \(CDS\) objects do not always resolve their dependencies in the first mass activation attempt so that you have to activate them in multiple cycles.
-   Service bindings need to be activated after service definitions.

If activation issues occur, repeatedly try to activate objects in the right sequence. If that does not work, try reimporting and reactivating objects multiple times until all objects of your application are active.



> ### Tip:  
> If you face any issues with the official abapGit distribution of SAP, create an incident using component `BC-CP-ABA`.
> 
> For issues related to the community open-source distribution of abapGit, create an issue at [https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit/issues).

> ### Note:  
> It is possible to define the external systems, the ABAP system is allowed to communicate with, by maintaining a list of trusted certificate authorities. Please use the Maintain Certificate Trust List app to do so. This app can be used by administrators, users with the SAP\_BR\_ADMINISTRATOR role. For further information, please go to [Maintain Certificate Trust List](../50-administration-and-ops/maintain-certificate-trust-list-2b3c3f1.md)

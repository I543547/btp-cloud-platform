The name of the technical user for consuming the SAP SuccessFactors HXM Suite OData API without a logged-in user.

> ### Caution:  
> This property specifies the *systemUser* property in the destination that is created as a result of creating the SAP SuccessFactors Extensibility service instance.
> 
> The *systemUser* is deprecated and will be removed soon. We recommend that you work on behalf of specific \(named\) users instead of working with a technical user.
> 
> As an alternative for technical user communication, we strongly recommend that you use the Mutual Transport Layer Security \(mTLS\) protocol. See [Using Mutual Transport Layer Security \(mTLS\)](using-mutual-transport-layer-security-mtls-ca4b9ab.md#loioca4b9ab3d0cb46ed8055388e125126a2).

> ### Note:  
> The technical user can be any user with the respective permissions. These permissions depend on the use case and the API you want to access. To find out which permission you need to assign to the technical user, go to [SAP Business Accelerator Hub](https://api.sap.com/), find the SAP SuccessFactors API you want to access and from the *Overview* tab go to the *Documentation* section and open the *help.sap.com* link. There you find the right information for each API.

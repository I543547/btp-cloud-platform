# Configure the Entitlements for SAP Event Mesh

To be able to consume SAP S/4HANA Cloud events, you need to configure the entitlements for SAP Event Mesh for the subaccount in SAP BTP.



## Context

The *messaging* service plan connects SAP S/4HANA Cloud tenant to SAP Event Mesh for the subaccount where the SAP Event Mesh service entitlement is configured. This SAP Event Mesh service instance allows you to consume events from SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

You need to configure the entitlements for the SAP Event Mesh service to create an SAP Event Mesh service instance. Then, you bind this service instance to an application to consume events from this application.

## Process Flow

> ### Note:  
> Use the manual configuration steps only if your scenario is not covered by the automated process with SAP BTP. If you configure the integration between the cloud platform and SAP S/4HANA Cloud manually, you may not be able to benefit from any automations.

You have to configure the cloud platform extension integration with SAP S/4HANA Cloud to enable the use of applications running on top of the platform from SAP S/4HANA Cloud.

These are the steps you need to follow:

1.  Set up the extension subaccount in SAP BTP by configuring the single sign-on. See [SAP BTP Extension Onboarding for SAP S/4HANA Cloud](sap-btp-extension-onboarding-for-sap-s-4hana-cloud-8ea90d1.md).

2.  Configure the extension application and create the respective destination in the SAP BTP cockpit. See [Extension Application Configuration](extension-application-configuration-c73342d.md).

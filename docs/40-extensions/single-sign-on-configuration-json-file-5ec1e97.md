The name of the system you have registered in the global account in SAP BTP

**Rules/Guidelines**

The name must be the same as the one defined during the system registration in the global account. See [Register an SAP SuccessFactors System in a Global Account in SAP BTP](register-an-sap-successfactors-system-in-a-global-account-in-sap-btp-e956ba2.md).

`logoutURLs`

</td>
<td valign="top">

\(Optional\) This is a list of the logout URLs. A logout URL is the absolute URL that corresponds to the URL of the application router with the appended value of the `logoutEndpoint` property. See [logout](../30-development/logout-2296b4d.md).

> ### Note:  
> Make sure that the value of the `logoutMethod` property is set to `GET` in the *xs-app.json* file.

> ### Note:  
> The `SameSite` attribute of the `Set-Cookie` HTTP response header needs to be set to `None` so that the cookies are sent in all responses to both first-party and cross-origin requests. You also need to set the cookie `Secure` attribute, because it requires a secure context/HTTPS. See [Environment Variables](../30-development/environment-variables-ba52705.md).

> ### Note:  
> If you don't specify the `logoutURLs` parameter, only an assertion consumer service for the subaccount in SAP BTP will be created.

# Application Jobs

Find out more about application jobs in SAP and how they can be helpful.



Many business activities have to be run periodically. To avoid starting these activities manually each time, you can create application job templates and schedule them as application jobs in the *Application Jobs* app.

An application job template can be scheduled as an application job. In the scheduling dialog, you as a business user can determine a periodic start condition \(such as every first Monday of the month at 1:00\), and you can set appropriate parameter values for the application job execution. The application job will then be run automatically without further manual interaction, whenever the start condition is fulfilled.

SAP also offers the *Application Job Templates* app. In this app, you can create new templates by saving an existing template with new parameter values. You can also connect existing templates to multistep templates. Running a multistep template means running all steps sequentially.

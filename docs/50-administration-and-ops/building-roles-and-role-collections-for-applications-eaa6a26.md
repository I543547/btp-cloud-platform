# Building Roles and Role Collections for Applications

As an administrator of the Cloud Foundry environment of SAP BTP, you can maintain application roles and role collections which can be used in user management.

The user roles are derived from role templates that are defined in the security description \(`xs-security.json`\) of applications that have been registered as OAuth 2.0 clients at the User Account and Authentication service during application deployment. The application security-descriptor file also contains details of the authorization scopes that are used for application access and defines any attributes that need to be applied. The roles you create can be added to role collections.

You can perform the following tasks:

-   Create and delete user roles

    User roles define authorization scopes and are based on the role templates and scopes defined in the application's security descriptor file

-   Add user roles to one or more “role collections”
-   Configure and manage role collections

> ### Tip:  
> Using the SAP BTP cockpit, you can assign the role collections to users logging on with SAML 2.0 assertions or SAP ID service.

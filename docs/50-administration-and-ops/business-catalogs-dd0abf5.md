# Business Catalogs

You use this app to display all available business catalogs.



With this app you can get an overview of the business catalogs, their status \(for example *Deprecated*\), and their usage within business roles. You use this application to see which applications and business catalogs delivered by SAP have changed, for example after an upgrade. They may also be deprecated. As a key user, you need to have an overview of these changes to adapt the affected business roles accordingly.

## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Display business catalogs, their usage in roles, and general description

-   Display business catalog changes: Check if the business catalogs or apps in your area have changed \(for example, a transaction has been replaced with an SAP Fiori app\), and which business roles are affected by these changes.

-   Display assigned apps: You can display apps that have their own tile access \(classified as*Standard Application*\) as well as ones that can be started indirectly via app-to-app navigation \(classified as *Standard Navigation Target*\).

-   Display deprecations: Check if any of the business catalogs in your area are deprecated and which successors they will be replaced with. Select the affected business role and transfer the changes.

-   Display dependencies: Check if a business catalog depends on other business catalogs or if other business catalogs depend on a business catalog in order to be fully operational.

-   Display scope items: check which scope items the business catalogs depend on. Business catalogs that do not depend on any scope items are always visible in the system. For these business catalogs, *Scope Items \(0\)* is displayed on the relevant tab and the following message appears in the table: *The business catalog is not scope-dependent*.

-   Display component: check under which component you can create an incident if required.

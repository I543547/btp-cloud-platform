Create spaces in your Cloud Foundry organization using the SAP BTP cockpit.



<a name="loio2f6ed22ccf424dae84345f4500c2d8ea__prereq_yys_bjm_qz"/>

## Prerequisites

You have a Cloud Foundry organization in your Cloud Foundry subaccount, and you have the Org Manager role in that organization.

See [Create Orgs](create-orgs-a9b1f54.md).

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to the subaccount that contains the Cloud Foundry organization in which you'd like to create a space.

2.  On the subaccount *Overview* page, you have a *Spaces* table. Choose *Create Space* from the top right hand-side corner of that table.

3.  Enter a space name and choose the permissions you'd like to assign to your ID, then choose *Save*.

## Next Steps

To assign quota to spaces, see [Edit Space Quotas](edit-space-quotas-2a58364.md).

You can change the name of a space by going to the *Cloud Foundry* \> *Spaces* page from the left hand-side navigation and choosing ![](images/Edit_Icon_abfe424.png) \(Edit\) on the tile of that space. You can also create additional spaces from there.

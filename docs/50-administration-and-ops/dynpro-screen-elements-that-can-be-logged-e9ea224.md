# Dynpro Screen Elements that Can Be Logged

A list of screen elements in Dynpro applications that can have read access logged.

The main scope of Read Access Logging is to log output fields on result screens. Optionally, also the input fields of the corresponding selection or query screens can be logged. Logging and defining a log context are supported for such selection or query screens and their result screens if both are implemented and processed in the same program. Please note that one business transaction may be processed using more than one program. In such cases, logging of the input is not possible.

The table below shows the basic screen elements that can be logged in Dynpro applications.

For each radio button, a value is logged \(true/false\). Note that each radio button is logged separately. There is no logging of entire groups of radio buttons.

Subscreens

</td>
<td valign="top">

As subscreens consist of the same elements as screens, logging takes place for the elements of subscreens in the same way as for screens

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Select-Options

</td>
<td valign="top">

Value of each select-option of a selection screen \(list of sign, option, low/high values\).

A select-option `SELOPT` is displayed as:

-   a `LOW` or `HIGH` field for a single selection
-   a push-button \(arrow icon\) for a multiple selection that is represented as a table of fields \(`SIGN`, `OPTION`, `LOW`, `HIGH`\)

To be able to log `SELOPT-LOW` or `SELOPT-HIGH` fields, they have to be configured.

You can enter the data to `SELOPT-LOW` or `SELOPT-HIGH` manually:

-   If a program was executed without a screen round trip, the fields `SELOPT-LOW` and `SELOPT-HIGH` can be logged as input fields.
-   The multiple selection is attached to the `SELOPT-LOW` field: if the field `SELOPT-LOW` is configured for logging, the multiple selection is configured for logging as well. If a screen round trip was done \(e.g. pressing [Enter\]\), or if the multiple selection was used, the `SELOPT` data is added to the multiple selection table, therefore the `SELOPT-LOW` field can be logged as an input or output field.

If a variant that is used to provide the input data for a selection-option shall be logged, it has to be configured for output logging. Input data provided for the multiple selection can be logged, even if it was not displayed.

Input data provided via variant for other parameter fields on a selection screen can be logged using the input logging.

> ### Note:  
> To be sure that all the data related to the select-option field is logged, it should be configured for both input and output logging.

Tab strip

</td>
<td valign="top">

Same logging behavior as for subscreens. If switching tabs happens on front-end, logging is done together for all tabs. If, on the other hand, switching tabs happens on application level, the tabs are logged separately. In addition, an OK code can only be logged when switching tabs happens on application level.

ABAP Lists

</td>
<td valign="top">

ABAP lists can be recorded by choosing the read access logging function from the context menu. The pseudo field `$_LIST_CODE` will be added to the created recording. Using this pseudo field, all lists of a program can be configured for logging. It is not possible to log input fields and OK codes of a list.

</td>
</tr>

It is not possible to log other screen objects, such as the following:

-   Input-enabled ALV grid
-   ALV tree
-   File download

# Find Users and Their Role Collection Assignments

You want to find the authorizations granted to specific users in your global account and subaccount. You can search or sort the list of users, and view their role collection assignments.



## Context

You want to find out which authorizations have been granted to single or multiple users. To do so, access the list of all users, find the users you want to review, and check the role collection assignment. From the user's role collection, you can drill down to the roles of the role collection.



## Procedure

1.  Open the SAP BTP cockpit.

2.  Go to your global account and/or subaccount \(see [Navigate in the Cockpit](navigate-in-the-cockpit-0874895.md)\).

3.  Choose *Security* \> *Users*.

    You see all the users of your subaccount.

    > ### Tip:  
    > If you want to see users that were updated before a certain point of time, use the *Last Updated* field. You can filter the list according to the point of time of the last update.

4.  To search for users, choose :mag: \(Search\).

5.  Enter a string occurring in the user name, last name, first name, or e-mail address. The SAP BTP cockpit returns a list of all the users containing this string.

6.  Select a user and open the overview section.

    You can see all of the role collection assignments of this user. You can also drill down into the roles.

# How to Compare Business Roles



<a name="copy0c21b34ee55949ceb2b5444def63d098__context"/>

## Context

To display the common features and the differences between business roles, you can compare them in the *Maintain Business Roles* app. On the *Compare Business Roles* screen, you can display the restrictions, business users, business catalogs and launchpad spaces, which the business roles have in common, or those that the business roles donâ€™t have in common. You can only compare a maximum of two business roles. They can be active or in draft mode.

## Procedure

1.  On the *Maintain Business Roles* initial screen, select the two business roles you want to compare.

2.  Click *Compare*. The system displays the*Compare Business Roles* screen for these two business roles including information about the assigned restrictions, business users, business catalogs and launchpad spaces.

    If the *Write*, *Read* or *Value Help* access category is restricted in both roles, you can navigate further to display the assigned restriction types for that access category.

    **Restrictions**

    You have the following options for comparing restrictions:

    *Display All*

    Display all restriction types assigned to one of the roles or to both.

    *Display Same Restriction Types with Same Values*

    Display the restriction types that are assigned to both roles and have the same values in both roles.

    *Display Same Restriction Types with Different Values*

    Display the restriction types that are assigned to both roles and have different values in each role.

    *Display only Differences*

    Display only the differences between the two roles, for example if a restriction type is only assigned to one role but not to the other role.

    **The restriction types are coloured as follows:**


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    Colour
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    Explanation
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Green
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    The restriction type is assigned to both roles and in both roles, the values are the same.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Orange
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    The restriction type is assigned to both roles but the values are different.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Red
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    The restriction type is only assigned to one role but not to the other.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    If the restriction types are colored in green or orange, you can navigate further and display more details.

    The system displays the restriction types assigned to the roles you want to compare next to each other. If there are differences between the two roles, the order of the instances reflects the degree of similarity. You can use drag and drop if you want to compare two other restriction types than the ones suggested by the system.

    **Business Users, Business Catalogs and Launchpad Spaces**

    You have the following options for comparing business users, business catalogs and launchpad spaces:

    *Display All*

    Display all business users, business catalogs and launchpad spaces that are assigned to one of the roles or both.

    *Display Only Common Business Users / Display Only Common Business Catalogs / Display Only Common Launchpad Spaces*

    Display only the business users, business catalogs or launchpad spaces the two business roles have in common or that are assigned to both.

    *Display only Different Business Users / Display only Different Business Catalogs / Display Only Different Launchpad Spaces*

    Display only the business users, business catalogs or launchpad spaces that differ from one business role to the other or that are assigned to one business role but not to the other.

# IAM Key Figures





You can use this app to display the following information:

-   Number of business users assigned to business roles

-   Month of the business userâ€™s last log-on

-   Number of locked and unlocked business users

-   Validity of business users

-   Number of business roles with unmaintained restrictions
-   Number of business roles with unrestricted access

    > ### Note:  
    > You can filter for the productive business roles in your area, for example by adding a certain namespace followed by an asterisk \(\*\) in the *Filter by Business Role ID* field in the tile configuration.

-   Business user price categories
-   Business roles with default values from business catalogs

    The default values are delivered automatically and can't be overwritten. This means either that an asterisk \(\*\) overwrites all defined values or that fixed values are added to the restrictions you have defined. Business roles affected by these non-changeable values are displayed in red in the overview chart.

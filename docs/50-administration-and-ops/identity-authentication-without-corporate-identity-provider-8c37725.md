# Identity Authentication Without Corporate Identity Provider

You've only changed the protocol of the trust configuration between your SAP BTP subaccount and Identity Authentication.

Copy the following configurations from the old SAML-based Identity Authentication application to your new OIDC-based Identity Authentication application:

-   Subject name identifier

    See [Configure the Subject Name Identifier Sent to the Application](http://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/1d020e3a3ba34c43a71fde70bfa6419a.html) in the documentation of Identity Authentication.

-   Assertion attributes

    Change the names of the following assertion attributes as listed in the following table.


    <table>
    <tr>
    <th valign="top">

    From User Attribute
    
    </th>
    <th valign="top">

    To Assertion Attribute
    
    </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    first\_name
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    given\_name
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    last\_name
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    family\_name
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    mail
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    email
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    See [Configure the User Attributes Sent to the Application](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/d361407d36c5443298a909acbbd96ec4.html) in the documentation of Identity Authentication.

-   Default attributes

    See [Configure the Default Attributes Sent to the Application](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/a2f1e4692e7d4379ab82144ab309e7b3.html) in the documentation of Identity Authentication.

## Procedure

1.  Log on to the SAP Fiori launchpad as an administrator user.

2.  With the *Maintain Business Roles* app, create and edit business roles and add business catalogs to the roles.

    1.  To grant access to the *Assign Recipients to Users* app, add the business catalog *Communication Management – Message Monitoring Configuration* \(SAP\_CA\_BC\_COM\_CONF\_PC\) to a business role.

    2.  To grant access to the *Message Dashboard* app, add the business catalog *Business Network Integration* \(SAP\_BR\_CONF\_EXPERT\_BUS\_NET\_INT\) to a business role.


    Both business catalogs are also contained in the business role template *Configuration Expert – Business Network Integration* \(SAP\_BR\_CONF\_EXPERT\_BUS\_NET\_INT\).

3.  With the *Maintain Business User* app, provide business users with access rights.

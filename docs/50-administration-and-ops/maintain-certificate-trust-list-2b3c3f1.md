## Key Features

You can use this app to:



-   Display a list of all already existing trusted certificates

-   Upload a new certificate

-   Display detailed information

-   Check for updates of certificate trusts and adopt the changes if required.
-   Automatically apply all changes to the SAP trust list in your trust list after an upgrade. You can either just add new certificates or add new certificates and simultaneously remove deleted certificates.

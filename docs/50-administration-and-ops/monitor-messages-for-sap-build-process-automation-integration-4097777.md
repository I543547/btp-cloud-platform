## Context

With the *Message Dashboard* or *Message Monitoring Overview*, you can monitor and administrate the SAP Build Process Automation background processing. You can manually trigger or cancel monitored background tasks that have issues.

AIF messages are deleted after a retention time, which can be configured in AIF customizing. The default value for all workflow-relevant namespaces and interfaces is set to 7 days.



## Procedure

1.  Log on to the SAP Fiori launchpad as an administrator user.

2.  With the *Assign Recipients to Users* app, assign the corresponding recipients to a business user.

    1.  Select the user for which you want to perform the assignment.

    2.  Repeatedly choose *Assign* and successively enter the following recipients:


        <table>
        <tr>
        <th valign="top">

        Namespace
        
        </th>
        <th valign="top">

        Recipient
        
        </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td valign="top">
        
        `/SWFCP`\(for workflow capability\)
        
        </td>
        <td valign="top">
        
        *REC\_PROC\_BGRFC \(process bgRFC\)*

        REC\_RAISE\_EVT \(Recipient for raise of event\)
        
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td valign="top">
        
        `/SWFPV` \(for process visibility capability\)
        
        </td>
        <td valign="top">
        
        *EVENT\_PUBL \(Process bgRFC\)* 
        
        </td>
        </tr>
        </table>
        
        Also choose the message types that the user is allowed to view.

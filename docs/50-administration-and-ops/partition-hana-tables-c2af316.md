# Partition HANA Tables

**App ID:** F5466



With this app you can break down large columnar tables into partitions. By default, database tables on SAP HANA are not partitioned. The SAP HANA database allows for a maximum number of approximately two billion records per table. If this threshold is exceeded, your application stops working. To avoid this, you need to partition your tables in time.



## Key Features

This app provides the following key features:



-   Search for large tables that can be partitioned according to certain filter criteria

-   Partition large tables

-   Undo the partitioning of a table by merging the partitions of a table back into one table


> ### Note:  
> With this app you can only partition your own tables or tables that have explicitly been classified for partitioning by SAP.

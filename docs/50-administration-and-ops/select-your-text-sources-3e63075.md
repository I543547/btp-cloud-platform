## Procedure

1.  In the *Maintain Customizing Translations* app, open the project you want to add text sources to.
2.  Scroll down to *Text Sources* and click *Add*.
3.  Here you can select which text source types to add. The following text source types are supported:
    -   UI runtime adaptations

        > ### Note:  
        > Mind that only the translation of those UI runtime adaptations which have been recorded on a Customizing transport request are supported. UI runtime adaptations which have not been recorded at all or have been recorded on a workbench request will not be considered
        > 
        > For more information on how to work with UI runtime adaptations, see [Adapting SAP Fiori UIs at Runtime - Key User Adaptation](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-fiori-launchpad-for-sap-btp/adapting-sap-fiori-uis-at-runtime-key-user-adaptation)

    -   `SAP Fiori launchpad` Pages

    -   `SAP Fiori launchpad` Spaces

        > ### Note:  
        > For more information on how to manage launchpad pages and spaces, see [Manage Launchpad Pages](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/10fd1742ea914256abedb34bf15bd069/8a174e235493472095c0bcec957dfee0.html) and [Manage Launchpad Spaces](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/10fd1742ea914256abedb34bf15bd069/ad119b284f8249cfb4c3fc86c76404c5.html).

    -   Text tables

        > ### Note:  
        > A database table needs to fulfill the following requirements to be considered a text table by the app:
        > 
        > -   The delivery class of the text table has to be C
        > -   There must be exactly one language key field
        > -   Every character-like, non key field with a length greater than one will be treated as a text attribute
        > -   The translation of text tables that contain key fields of type p \(packed number\), i \(integer\) or x \(byte field\) is not supported. That includes any kind of UUID and raw types, such as `SYSUUID_X16`.


4.  Select *Add* to open the *Add Text Source* dialog which displays all text sources that can be added to the translation project. By filtering the type and name, you can choose the text sources you want to add. Select *Add* to add the text sources you selected to your translation project.

> ### Note:  
> The total amount of texts in a translation project must not exceed 1000. Be aware that a text source might contain more than one text.

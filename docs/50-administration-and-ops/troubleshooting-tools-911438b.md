# Troubleshooting Tools

Apart from debugging, you can also use other troubleshooting tools, such as the Feed Reader view in ABAP development tools for Eclipse, ABAP Profiler as well as the SQL Explain and SQL Trace Analysis SAP Fiori apps.

## Feed Reader

ABAP Development Tools provides a dedicated view, the Feed Reader View, for runtime errors \(ABAP short dumps\) and gateway errors. See [Feed Reader View](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/Cloud/en-US/5a71017726964694b67372ca45d64643.html).

## ABAP Profiler



### ABAP Trace

The ABAP Profiler allows you to examine the performance of your implemented business logic by using function modules and global ABAP classes. You can use the ABAP trace, which is the result of the ABAP Profiler, to identify runtime-intensive statements and to follow the hierarchy of program calls. See [Profiling ABAP Code](https://help.sap.com/viewer/5371047f1273405bb46725a417f95433/Cloud/en-US/4ec41bbe6e391014adc9fffe4e204223.html).



### ABAP Cross Trace

If you develop OData services or other ABAP functionality related to the ABAP RESTful application programming model , the ABAP Cross Trace gives you insights into the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model runtime framework. This includes the processing of OData requests, for example in SAP Fiori applications, and contains functionality similar to the payload trace of SAP Gateway trace in SAP GUI.

## SQL Trace Analysis SAP Fiori App

With the SQL Trace Analysis app, you can access and analyze SQL trace records after you have used the SQL trace function of the ABAP performance trace in ABAP development tools for Eclipse. See [SQL Trace Analysis](sql-trace-analysis-ed7805c.md).

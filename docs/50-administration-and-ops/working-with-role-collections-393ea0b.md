# Working with Role Collections

You can manage role collections by creating new ones from scratch or by copying an existing one and editing it. You can add or remove roles. You can also add or remove users or user groups to the role collections. This is the assignment or unassignment action. You can drill down all the way to the role definition or to the individual role, user, and user group, and make changes there.

-   The roles defined by your application developers in the application security descriptor are available in the SAP BTP cockpit. For more information, see [Adding Authentication and Authorization](../30-development/adding-authentication-and-authorization-419ae2e.md).

-   The users are stored in identity providers that are connected to SAP BTP.

    -   Default identity provider \(`SAP ID service`\). For more information, see [Default Identity Provider](default-identity-provider-d6a8db7.md).

> ### Note:  
> SAP BTP provides default role collections. You can use the default role collections, but you canâ€™t change or delete them. For this reason, the *Delete* icon of a default role collection is grayed out.

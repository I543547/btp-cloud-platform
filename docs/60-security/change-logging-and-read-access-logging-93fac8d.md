# Change Logging and Read-Access Logging

Change logging records changes to personal data, while read-access logging records access to sensitive personal data. You may be required to gather this information for auditing purposes or legal requirements.





Use the appropriate API to retrieve logs.

For the Cloud Foundry environment, see [Audit Log Retrieval API Usage for the Cloud Foundry Environment](../50-administration-and-ops/audit-log-retrieval-api-usage-for-the-cloud-foundry-environment-30ece35.md).

> ### Note:  
> For any applications you develop, you must ensure they include logging functions. SAP BTP does not provide audit logging functions for custom developments.

Logs are deleted regularly.

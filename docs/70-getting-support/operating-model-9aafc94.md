# Operating Model

An operating model clearly defines the separation of tasks between SAP and the customer during all phases of an integration project.



The environment and its services have been developed on the assumption that specific processes and tasks are the responsibility of the customer. The operating model contains all processes and tasks involved in operating the platform and the services and specifies how the responsibilities are divided between SAP and the customer for each individual task. It doesnâ€™t include the operation of systems and devices residing at operational facilities owned by the customer or any other third party, as these are the customer's responsibility.

Changes to the operating model defined for the services in scope are published using the *What's New* section of the platform. Customers and other interested parties must review the product documentation on a regular basis. If critical changes are made to the operating model, which require action on the customer side, an explicit notification is sent by e-mail to the affected customers.

It isn't the intent of this document to supplement or modify the contractual agreement between SAP and the customer for the purchase of any of the services in scope. In the event of a conflict, the contractual agreement between SAP and the customer as set out in the Order Form, the General Terms and Conditions, the supplemental terms and conditions, and any resources referenced by those documents always takes precedence over this document.
